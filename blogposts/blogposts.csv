1,f2ffc569-48a2-4b2c-8b57-6f08b4fffdd7,Flashback Fridays - Data Storage,welcome-to-ghost,"Currently, the lab uses a [Synology Diskstation 1813+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS1815+) as its primary data storage. Configured RAID 5+2 with one hot spare with 3TB drives, we get about 15TB of total storage. The original configuration relied on Seagate drives, which unfortunately [were super unreliable](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-reliability-q4-2015/) - we've now replaced half of them with Hitachi drives.

#### To the cloud
We're now thinking about where to go for more permanent storage. The Synology software supports [Amazon Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/) storage, which at $0.007 / GB / month appears to be about the cheapest option. We still need to figure out a backup flow that will accommodate the fact that Glacier storage is not meant to be accessed regularly. If only we could use our Google drive space, which is unlimited and free -- unfortunately, it's reported that they throttle uploads severely after a few hundred MB. I'm quite curious about what other labs are doing on this front.

#### Flashback
It seems like a good time to repost video from 2013 of the first spikes recorded in the lab.

2,878bae20-9c95-425d-866d-24e371545808,Differences in Spatial Coding during Slow and Fast Gamma,gamma-bands-and-theta-sequences,"Welcome to the first recap of our lab's journal club! This week we covered [Zheng et al.'s Spatial Sequence Coding Differs during Slow and Fast Gamma Rhythms in the Hippocampus](http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(15)01076-4). 

The sequential firing of place cells as an animal traverses its place fields is a well-documented phenomenon. One way to analyze place cell activity is to look at the spikes relative to the theta oscillation (~6-10 Hz), which are known as [theta sequences](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.20345). Likewise, aligning the spikes to the gamma oscillation (~25-100 Hz) results in gamma sequences. The authors specifically investigated theta sequences relative to slow (~25-55 Hz) and fast (~60-100 Hz) gamma (""theta-nested gamma sequences""). 

This image is a nice summary of the hypotheses the paper examined:
![](/content/images/2016/10/pic-1.jpg)
The hypotheses concerned the path length/trajectories encoded within a gamma sequence. In hypothesis A, **discrete spatial locations** are encoded within an individual gamma cycle. Thus, the trajectories encoded during fast gamma will span a greater distance than those during slow gamma because there are more fast gamma cycles within one theta cycle. On the other hand, hypothesis B claims that a **sequence** of locations is represented within an individual slow gamma cycle. Then, a theta-nested gamma sequence will cover greater distance during slow gamma than during fast gamma.

The authors found that slow gamma sequences had significantly larger temporal compression (locations spanned by the sequence aka ""x-span"" divided by the duration of the sequence aka ""t-span"") than fast gamma sequences. Bayesian analysis was used to decode the sequences and showed that the locations represented during fast gamma correlated much better with current location of the animal than did slow gamma, which had higher temporal compression. The t-spans of slow and fast gamma sequences were not significantly different, countering the argument that slow gamma could have spanned a longer distance merely because the sequence duration was greater. As usual, it helps to have a figure. Note that the dotted white line represents the animal's current location.
![](/content/images/2016/10/pic-2.jpg)

One of the most important results was the presence of phase precession in gamma sequences. In a theta sequence, a place cell will fire at an earlier and earlier phase of an individual theta cycle as an animal moves through that cell's place field. Thus, the phase of a spike reveals information about where in the place field the animal is. Phase procession was observed for slow gamma but not fast gamma sequences, suggesting that the phase of slow gamma codes spatial information. 

Finally, the authors found that the number of fast gamma cycles per theta cycle increased with path length of the theta sequence. The number of slow gamma cycles did not increase likewise. Assuming hypothesis B, the result for fast gamma is consistent. That is, if a discrete spatial location is encoded within an individual fast gamma cycle, to span a longer path in one theta cycle, there would need to be more fast gamma cycles. In the case of slow gamma, it is less clear whether the results support hypothesis B. For example, if we know that place cells A,B,C fire in a slow gamma sequence and that the number of gamma cycles per theta cycle does not increase, in order to span a longer path, more than 3 place cells would fire within the same number of gamma cycles, such as place cells A,B,C,D,E. This doesn't necessarily imply that the basic unit of a slow gamma cycle is a sequence of locations rather than discrete locations, as hypothesis B proposes.

While the results did not provide conclusive support for hypothesis B, the paper nonetheless gave a plausible working model, linking fast gamma to encoding of current location in real time and slow gamma to retrieval of stored memories in a time-compressed fashion. We look forward to future studies about the characterization and functionality of different gamma rhythm subtypes!

Our joint journal club with the Ji lab this week read the paper [**""Prefrontal neuronal assemblies temporally control fear behaviour""**](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7612/abs/nature18630.html) by Dejean, Courtin, Karalis, Chaudan, Wurtz, Bienvenu, and Herry that appeared in Nature earlier this year. They recorded in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in mice who had experienced auditory fear conditioning one or two days before the recording. 

#### There were four important results:

  1. When the mice were freezing (see below), they saw  a clear and strong **~4 Hz oscillation** in the local field potential.
  ![4 Hz LFP](/content/images/2016/10/4HzLFP.png)

  2. When the mice were freezing a subset of the neurons that they recorded from were active in ensemble bursts that they called **""neuronal assemblies""**. They spent a chunk of time showing that these burst activations were tied to the aforementioned 4 Hz oscillation. 
  ![Neuronal assemblies](/content/images/2016/10/AssemblyExample.png)

  3. There appeared to be some sort of **phase coding** of the assemblies. Specifically, neurons seemed to have a preferred phase, which thus organized ""assemblies"" into ""sequences"".
  ![Phase Coding](/content/images/2016/10/PhaseCoding.png)

  4. When they used channelrhodopsin expressed in PV+ interneurons to inactivate the circuit in a 4 Hz phase-dependent manner, they found cool effects: decreased freezing if the inactivation coincided with the assembly-active 4 Hz half-cycle and increased freezing if the inactivation coincided with the assembly inactive 4 Hz half cycle.
  ![Phase-specific ChR2](/content/images/2016/10/PhaseSpecificChR2.png)

#### My conclusion
The phase coding results - both the potential existence of nice sequences during fear memory expression AND the fact that LFP phase-specific manipulation of the circuit resulted in clear and distinguishable effects - _were super exciting_. However, **(1)** I wasn't completely convinced by the information they presented about whether the ""assemblies"" are actually sequences (they didn't claim this but hinted at it). And, **(2)** I really wish they had presented a bit better statistics on how reliable the burst patterns (""assembly firing"") occurred. Did the neurons fire every cycle.  And, **(3)** they could have done a much better job assessing links between neural activity and the auditory stimuli (both conditioned and unconditioned).

#### More details
**Behavioral task:** Their protocol was a bit unusual. The day after shock, they'd put the mice in a new environment and then play brief beeps of the conditioned stimuli (the same 30 s duration used during pairing with the shock experiences) and the unconditioned stimuli (a different sound that never coincided with shock), and watch the mice freeze. Technically, they didn't _watch_ the mice - they used a beam breaking system rather than video. This gave them a nice low-latency access to the behavior that was probably technically orders of magnitude easier than using real-time video tracking. However, it does beg the question of whether the freezing they detect is the same as video-based analyses would produce. This is largely unimportant for the results.

**4 Hz Oscillation:** See the figure above. I'm convinced - this is a real thing. I think the question that's left is whether its connected to the 4 Hz rhythm report previously by [Fujisawa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982376) that was coherent between mPFC, VTA, and hippocampus. Or is it related to slow wave sleep and delta rhythms? Or is it just something new?

The researchers disrupted SWRs in mice expressing Arch-EGFP in CA1 pyramidal cells while lacking expression in CA3 and other CA1 cell types after exploration of open-fields. 

### Experiment
<img src=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164675.g001&size=large"">
The experiment, graphically depicted in the above figure, involved opteogenetic ripple disruption in mice, noted as SWR blockade days, and delayed (1.32 seconds after ripple detection) optogenetic intervention after mice foraged open-fields. The general ripple disruptions, depicted as larger green lightning bolts, are 200 ms triggers of a 561 nm laser light. The smaller green lightning bolts, denoted inhibition control, are light pulses of half intensity relative to the general ripple disruptions. The authors validated their optogenetic intervention by showing the firing activity of multiple cells behaving as expected before, during, and after their intervention.

### Results
The main result found through this work is that optogenetic ripple disruption in CA1 pyramidal cells does not result in statistically significant differences in place field stability within CA1. The authors show this by studying place field stability within CA1 before and after SWR disruption while the mice forage the open-field.

<img src='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?id=info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0164675.g006&size=large'>

The above figure shows that at place cell firing rates before and after either timely or delayed SWR disruption do not show a generic trend. Some cells seemed to increase their firing rates after timely disruption while others did not. The authors note a substantial level of level of place cell stability on SWR-blockade days.

The left most figure above shows that sparsity of place cell firing (metric for place cell spatial localization) has statistically significant differences in between the control and SWR disruption experiments. Similar results are shown in the middle figure for place cell coherence (metric for place cell consistency before and after timely/delayed SWR disruption). However, the important note for these two figures is the statistically significant changes are expected to be seen across different experimental setups (different open-fields) in different days (control days vs SWR-blockade days) i.e. these changes should be observed regardless of optogenetic intervention. Additionally, the firing rates didn't change significantly in a particular experimental setup before or after optogenetic intervention. For the right most figure, the authors calculated cofiring vectors before and after control and SWR-blockade cases for CA1 cells. They found the correlations in between these vectors were not significantly changed due to ripple disruption. The authors thought they may see a change here due to SWRs being associated with replay and memory consolidation. As such, when ripples are blocked there may be changes within the CA1 place cell code but no such change was observed. 

Additional insignificant results, shown below, were found when looking at firing rate changes as well as place cell firing map correlations before and after timed/delayed ripple disruption cases. When looking at firing rate changes, only a small proportion of cells in both the control as well as ripple disruption cases displayed higher than 50 percent firing rate changes. Similarly, the average correlation in between the explorations of the open-field prior to and after timed/delayed ripple disruption showed average place cell firing map correlations of 0.5 as expected.

### My Conclusions
Overall, the paper provided an interesting observation that optogenetic disruption of SWRs during post-activity rest does not influence CA1 place cell stability in open-field foraging in mice. As the ensemble activity of CA1 cells during SWRs has been causally linked to memory consolidation, it definitely does need to be explained why disrupting ripples did not change CA1 place cell code during the SWR-blockade experiments (also noted by authors). The authors note that a larger cell population may be needed to be targeted with optogenetic inhibition for statistically significant results. Based on this statement, stimulating the ventral hippocampal commissure which silences the entire hippocampus and has been used in electrical ripple disruption experiments may also provide statistically significant results. In my opinion (also noted by the authors), place cell stability due to SWR disruption may be observed more if the task was goal oriented as opposed to only free exploration. Goal-oriented tasks would have ensemble activity of place cells sequentially related to the goal during SWRs, as opposed to random place cells firing that may not carry sequential firing relevance during SWRs in open-field exploration. As such, blocking SWRs during goal-oriented may result in changes in stable spatial representations in CA1.",,"<p>In the 2016 Halloween edition of our Journal Club (10/31 joint with Ji lab), we covered the paper <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164675"">Optogenetically Blocking Sharp Wave Ripple Events in Sleep Does Not Interfere with the Formation of Stable Spatial Representation in the CA1 Area of the Hippocampus</a> by Kovacs et al. published in PLoS ONE 2016.

<h3 id=""myconclusions"">My Conclusions</h3>

<p>Overall, the paper provided an interesting observation that optogenetic disruption of SWRs during post-activity rest does not influence CA1 place cell stability in open-field foraging in mice. As the ensemble activity of CA1 cells during SWRs has been causally linked to memory consolidation, it definitely does need to be explained why disrupting ripples did not change CA1 place cell code during the SWR-blockade experiments (also noted by authors). The authors note that a larger cell population may be needed to be targeted with optogenetic inhibition for statistically significant results. Based on this statement, stimulating the ventral hippocampal commissure which silences the entire hippocampus and has been used in electrical ripple disruption experiments may also provide statistically significant results. In my opinion (also noted by the authors), place cell stability due to SWR disruption may be observed more if the task was goal oriented as opposed to only free exploration. Goal-oriented tasks would have ensemble activity of place cells sequentially related to the goal during SWRs, as opposed to random place cells firing that may not carry sequential firing relevance during SWRs in open-field exploration. As such, blocking SWRs during goal-oriented may result in changes in stable spatial representations in CA1.</p>",,0,0,published,en_US,public,,,6,2016-11-23 18:12:18,6,2016-11-30 19:57:37,6,2016-11-24 07:49:07,6

The first part of the paper discusses the pros and cons of different modalities in analyzing neural activity *in vivo*. The modalities discussed include two photon microscopy, fiber photometry, electrophysiology, and imaging through a microendoscope. Two photon microscopy provides the best spatial resolution along with the ability for deep imaging, but it requires head fixation which limits the activities of the animal being studied. Fiber photometry allows for better movement of the animal, but it lacks cellular-level resolution and can only provide information on aggregate neural activity. Electrophysiology provides for the best temporal resolution and the ability for the free-range movement of the animal, but lacks the ability of the spatial location of the cells to be visualized and monitors fewer numbers of neurons than possible with imaging. 

The microendoscope overcomes several of the disadvantages of the other modalities. It provides imaging of a large number of neurons, free range movement of the animal, and the same field of view to be imaged over a long-time period. However, there are some downsides to this modality. One of these is the temporal resolution which is limited by the fluorescence indicator used and the frame rate possible with the imaging sensor. Furthermore, there could be some damage to the brain in the way the lens is implanted and also the data sets can be large and complex.

The paper then goes on to discuss the experimental design and the steps required in using a microendoscope shown above in Figure 2 from the paper. The first step is that the fluorescence indicator is injected into the area that you are interested in imaging. Second, the microendoscopic lens and baseplate is then implanted on the head of the animal. Last, the microscope can be easily attached or removed from the baseplate as needed. Once imaging starts, the fluorescence level indicates the neural activity. As mentioned before, the field of view will be maintained over the length of the experiment.

The experimenters used a delayed non-match-to sample spatial task on a continuous T-maze with 4 rats (shown above in Figure 1A). First, the rat was exposed to an open field maze and then put in a sleep box. Next, during the sample phase, the rat was forced to go in one direction on the maze. After a delay, the choice phase consisted of the rat correctly choosing the opposite direction as the sample phase for a reward. As mentioned before, both the sMEC and CA1 regions were simultaneously recorded from. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4, using a Bayesian maximum likelihood method, they were able to predict the position of the animal on the track separately using the CA1 pyramidal cells, the sMEC cells and the grid cells. As expected, the CA1 pyramidal cells show the highest probability density for the path, but the path was also able to be predicted from sMEC and grid cells. Next, they wanted to investigate if entorhinal cortex cells fire differentially at different phases of a spatial alteration task by analyzing firing rates on runs to the choice point for the four possible trial phases. The results are shown in the Supplementary Figure 5 and it can be seen that there were differences in the firing rates of different tasks. 

Since they were able to use the sMEC cells to predict the path on the maze, they wanted to see if there was evidence of replay in the sMEC during transient periods of high network synchronization called High Synchrony Events (HSEs). 
![alt text](https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6321/184/F2.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1)
Figure 2 is shown above. 2A shows an example of an HSE. Figure 2B expands the event out and shows how they used the Bayesian algorithm to come up with the 4 possible phases for the replay and the best fit. In Figure 2 D and E, they used shuffled data to show that the trajectory fit scores were better than the shuffled randomized data. Supplementary figure 10 shows how they identified theta phase precession in the 2 areas, but Supplementary figure 11 shows that the replay events were unlikely to be as a result of theta phase precession because the replay occurred at a two to three-fold rate faster than theta phase precession. 

Next, they wanted to see if the HSEs detected in the sMEC was correlated with activity in the CA1 region. Figure 2C shows examples of how the best fits for the sMEC activity didn’t relate to replay in the CA1 region and vice versa. Furthermore, supplementary figure 6 shows the firing responses during HSEs using a Z-score and cross correlation to the activity in the CA1 region. It can be seen that when there are high z-scores for events in the CA1 region, there is very minimal z-scores in the sMEC region. The same is shown for the high z-scores in the sMEC region vs the low scores in the CA1 region.  Figures 2F through I continue to discuss the lack of coherence between the activity in the 2 regions to demonstrate that the sMEC region appears to act independently of the CA1 region and vice versa. Figure 3 is pretty similar to Figure 2, but evaluates the sMEC and CA1 activity when the animal was sleeping. Again, they show evidence of replay in the sMEC and that this activity is independent of CA1 activity. 

The paper concluded the following. Their data showed that sMEC cells fired in relation to the memory task. There were bursts of activity in the sMEC during both waking and sleeping that contained replay of trajectories in the maze. The sMEC events occurred independently of the activity in the CA1 hippocampal trajectory replay. This suggests that the sMEC is capable of replaying events and initiate recall and consolidation processes independent of the hippocampal SWRs. They do mention that some weak coordination between the two areas was still seen. 

I am fairly new to the lab, so this paper introduced me to grid cells and helped further my understanding of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region. It also gave me a better understanding of the statistical analysis used and how to read many of the charts and figures that I have been confused about.

On February 20, I presented the journal paper [“Theta phase precession of grid and place cell firing in open environments”](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1635/20120532#T1) by Jeewajee et al. published in Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 2014.  

The authors analysed the relationship between phase and seven behavioral and physiological variables. They found that the distance to the firing field peak projected onto the current direction (pdcd) has the best correlation with the theta phase precession for both place and grid cells. However, the overall strength of phase precession was greater for place cells than for grid cells. 

### Background
Populations of pyramidal cells, in particular, place and grid cells in a rat hippocampus fire in response to the rat’s position during navigation of novel environments. As an animal explores a particular place, pyramidal cells become very active at that specific place, such cells are known as place cells while such place is known as place field. While the animal is running through the place field, the firing activity of place cells contains an oscillating voltage around 8 Hz known as the *theta rhythm*. As the animal approaches the landmark, the spiking of the place cell moves earlier in phase relative to the theta rhythm. This phase offset relative to spatial distance is known as **theta phase precession**. 
The image below illustrates relationship between position and distance in successive theta cycles.  
![alt](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a7633e9b1759fc96b5728320efc57433-c) 
The width of the bars indicates firing intensity of the hypothesized assemblies, while P1 to P8 represent overlapping place field. In successive theta cycles, assemblies shift together in time and sustain a temporal order relationship with each other so that the assembly that fires on the earliest phase represents a place field whose center the animal traverses first. The temporal compression mechanism (Skaggs et al., 1996) allows distances to be translated into time. Note that the assembly that represents the current location (sequence underdeath P5) is embedded in the representations of past (P1-P4) and future (P6-P8) locations.

### Transformation: mapping runs through fields onto the unit circle
An example of the transformation of a run through a firing field onto a unit circle which represents the firing field with the peak firing rate at the centre is shown below in (c).
![alt](http://d1vn86fw4xmcz1.cloudfront.net/content/royptb/369/1635/20120532/F1.large.jpg)
The authors transformed the locations on the ran radially so that their proportional distance between the firing peak and the perimeter is preserved, and then rotated about the centre of the circle so that the mean direction of the run (white arrow) is left–right for all runs. Recall that  *pdcd*  is the distance of the animal to the field peak projected on the current running direction.

###Results
Given the method above on mapping runs onto a unit circle, the authors then investigated the two-dimensional spatial distribution of firing phase of these cells. One important result presented in this paper is that firing phase decreases while firing phase variance increases from the first half to the second half of the field for both grid and place cells..
![alt](http://d1vn86fw4xmcz1.cloudfront.net/content/royptb/369/1635/20120532/F4.large.jpg)
Figure above illustrates two-dimensional distribution of firing phase (left) and circular phase variance (right) in CA1 place cells (a) and superficial layer medial entorhinal cortex grid cells (b). 
Note that phase appears to change most rapidly at the halfway point (where the projected distance to the peak changes sign on the left-to-right runs) and the phase variance increases at this point, a pattern that is most apparent in grid cells.
Finally, the authors found that in place cells, the rate of phase precession seems to increase on running through the centre of the firing field, compared with running through the edge of the firing field. However, this pattern is less pronounced in grid cells. In addition, Jeewajee et al. (2014) also showed that robust phase precession occurs during runs through the peripheral and the central in both place the grid cells, with a shallower slope in peripheral compared to central. 

In conclusion, while the authors did not provide more insight on 2D spatial distribution of firing phase and variance within the field, the result was consistent with previous analyses of place cells in open environment and on 1D linear track. In a simple model of navigation, we can assume that the animal returns to the landmark by moving to increase the match between the current pattern of place cell activity with the stored pattern. As noted previously by [Burgess et. al.(1996)]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9034860?access_num=9034860&link_type=MED&dopt=Abstract), theta phase precession is useful for navigation as it allows the animal to know whether its current direction is heading towards or away from a goal location by sampling locations ahead of or behind the animal within each theta cycle.

What about the files owned by a certain package? dpkg -L [package name]. Search for a package to install? sudo apt-cache search [name]. What a mess! In Arch, pacman can handle all of those operations in a less verbose manner. The corresponding commands would be sudo pacman -S [package name], sudo pacman -Q, sudo pacman -Ql [package name], sudo pacman -Ss [name]. So much simpler right? Arch wins this round. 

In addition I do not like the way software is bundled in Debian/Debian-based distros. For example, to use Mesa, you would install libglu1-mesa. But if you wanted the header files, you would also have to install libglu1-mesa-dev. Why? Mesa isn't segmented like this, so what's the deal here? In Arch, just install mesa and you have everything you need. I feel that this philosophy of fragmenting components is reflected in the way you need to use different commands for the operations listed above, whereas pacman can do all of those depending on which flags you choose.

#####Sane defaults
Ubuntu has more of a one-size-fits-all philosophy and things generally work/look decent. In Arch you will almost certainly have to tweak configuration files because the defaults will not be that great (especially the terminal emulators--default font rendering is usually atrocious!). Advantage: Ubuntu

##### Documentation
Arch has one of the best wiki's out there, so much so that users from other distros visit it to glean some insights. Ubuntu has its AskUbuntu pages and some community wiki's but those are not as well-organized or complete as Arch's. In general, I have not had a great experience with these, and sometimes I've had to search a 2009 post to fix an issue I encountered in 2018. Come on, man! That is simply unacceptable. Winner: Arch

##### System maintenance
Ubuntu is a point-release OS so there are fewer updates available. Because Arch is rolling release, you are constantly updating all your software. The advantage is you always have the latest, greatest, and 

##### Leveling up
Ubuntu tries to be user-friendly and generally succeeds in this. In some cases you might be able to do all your work through GUI applications and avoid the terminal completely. Arch uses the term ""user-centric"" rather than ""user-friendly."" Due to the fact that _you_ are responsible for setting up your system, you'll likely find yourself using the command line much more extensively. If you want the educational experience, greater familiarity with the terminal, and a feeling that you're a Linux expert (whether or not that perception matches reality), Arch is the way to go.
##### Community
Arch users are very tech savvy, and the wiki and forums reflect that. They know computers and expect you to as well. It's not as daunting as you think, though. Ubuntu caters toward beginners. If you're a beginner to Linux, I do recommend starting with Ubuntu for a couple of months and then you can play around with Arch.  
##### Bloat
This one is pretty straightforward. The Ubuntu installer installs a bunch of software by default, but a lot of it I don't actually need. In Arch you build your system from the ground up, and you install only the packages you want. An Arch system customized to your needs will thus be less bloated in general than a stock Ubuntu system.
##### Performance & Efficiency
Arch has the latest kernel so it should have better performance and efficiency (the latter is something Linus Torvalds was focusing on because Linux laptops unmodified from upstream have notoriously dismal battery life). But for whatever reason, I observe the opposite. Since Arch tries to use as unmodified upstream as it can, I'm guessing that among other things, Ubuntu has done a good job tweaking kernel parameters so that CPU usage isn't as heavy as Arch's. I haven't figured out how to be as efficient in Arch yet, so Ubuntu wins here.

##### Support
This is one of the most important if not the most important factor for a graduate student. For better or for worse (mostly worse in my opinion), most third-party software compatible with Linux will have been tested on Ubuntu. Arch definitely doesn't have this level of support. For example, TensorFlow isn't officially supported on Arch so if you run into issues, you're on your own. There's a higher potential things won't work on Arch--sometimes you need a specific version of a library and with Arch's rolling release model, that's a lot harder to do. Though I do enjoy figuring out how to make things work, I do not have unlimited time as a graduate student. Ubuntu clearly wins in this category.

Surprise, there really isn't a clear cut winner among these two Linux distros. It depends on what application you're using it for. Arch is great for development/testing, and keeping up to date with the latest and greatest software, while Ubuntu is preferred for generally taking less of your time. My conclusion is to use both distros if you can; at least you'll learn a lot and perhaps become more appreciative of the diversity of choices you have in the Linux world. Cheers!",,"<p>If you're in an engineering program, chances are you'll have to use a Linux machine at some point. When you wade into this arena, you'll quickly find that you have many choices of ""distros."" The main difference among these different flavors of Linux is the way they handle software package management and updates. Having used Ubuntu for years and more recently, Arch, I thought it might be useful to record my experiences, especially how they fit into an engineering graduate student's life.</p>
