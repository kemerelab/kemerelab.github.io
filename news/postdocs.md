##Interested in being a postdoc in the Kemere Lab?

The Realtime Neural Engineering Lab is always looking for talented individuals
to join the lab. The ideal applicant would have experience doing neural
recordings in awake behaving animals, strong data analysis skills, and a
particular interest in real-time manipulation of neural coding. Applicants with
a background in signal processing algorithms and the desire to shift focus to
experimental neurobiology (i.e., learning techniques for electrophysiology in
awake behaving rodents) will also potentially be considered.

Further information about the RNEL can be found on this website. Potential
applicants should review Jadhav et al (2012 Science), and other papers from the
PI and from the Frank Lab. Please send applications including an explanation of
interest in particular projects, a CV, and contact information for two
references to caleb.kemere [at] rice.edu.
