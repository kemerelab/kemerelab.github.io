##Undergraduate research in the RNEL

During a typical semester at Rice University, there are one to four undergraduates doing
research for course credit. The availability of these positions varies by year and depending on
the ebb and flow of ongoing research projects. Undergraduates typically assist with animal
behavioral experiments -- interest and excitement about neuroscience in behaving animal models
is a requirement for involvement in the lab. Students often additionally undertake embedded
systems, computational model, or data analysis projects under the oversight of other lab
members. Most projects are conducted as part of a team with graduate student or postdoctoral
mentors.

If you are interested in working in the lab, please **take a close look at our
research** (read the research sections on the website and related papers).
Then, please **send an email with your CV and a research statement explaining
your interest in the lab** (we canâ€™t reply to all generic emails received).

We occasionally welcome undergraduates who are not students at Rice University for summer
internships, but this typically requries bringing outside financial support. 

_Thanks for your interest!!_
