##Graduate research in the RNEL

The Kemere lab typically welcomes one to two new graduate students each year.
We primarily welcome students in the Rice Electrical and Computer
Engineering program, but also the Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience program (Prof. Kemere
is Adjunct Faculty at BCM), the SCBMB program, and other MD/PhD students from both BCM and
UTHS, as well as students in the Applied Physics, SSPB, or BIOE programs at Rice.
All of these programs have their own admissions processes. If you have applied
and have been accepted to one of these programs, Prof. Kemere is happy to respond to questions
to help you in your decision process.

If you are interested in working in the lab, please **take a close look at our
research** (read the research sections on the website and related papers).
Projects in the lab are focused on real-time neural signal processing
technology and related scientific questions about how dynamic neural activity
patterns support learning, memory, and motor behaviors (in Parkinsonâ€™s
disease). Most of our projects involve teams of students working together,
well-thought-out animal experiments, and signal processing / embedded systems
development. 

If you are thinking about applying feel free to send questions that aren't answered above.
