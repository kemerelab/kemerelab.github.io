##Graduate research in the RNEL

The Kemere lab typically welcomes one to two new graduate students each year.
If you are interested in working in the lab, please **take a close look at our
research** (read the research sections on the website and related papers).
Projects in the lab are focused on real-time neural signal processing
technology and related scientific questions about how dynamic neural activity
patterns support learning, memory, and motor behaviors (in Parkinson’s
disease). Most of our projects involve teams of students working together,
well-thought-out animal experiments, and signal processing / embedded systems
development. 

If you are interested in working in this sort of collaborative
way, please **send an email with your CV and a research statement explaining
your interest in the lab** (we can’t reply to all generic emails received). We
welcome students in (or applying to) the Rice Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Bioengineering programs, the Baylor College of Medicine
Neuroscience program (Prof. Kemere is Adjunct Faculty at BCM), the SCBMB
program, and other MD/PhD students from both BCM and UTHS. _Thanks for your
interest!_
