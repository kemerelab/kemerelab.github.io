### Using imaging to undersand neural systems

<div class="lead">
Genetically encoded fluorescent and bioluminescent indicators have opened a window (!)
into the activity of the brain which enables observation of hundreds or thousands of individual
neurons during behavior. Moreover, because access is optical, single neurons can be tracked
across days, enabling a systems-level view of the circuit dynamics which underly learning
and memory. We are developing novel imaging technologies which allow for these measurements
to be made in experimental contexts which were previously impossible, allowing us to study
neural systems in new and exciting ways.

#### Imaging technologies - Widefield Imaging with the FlatScope
Widefield imaging through the dorsal skull presents the opportunity to observe much of the
rodent neocortex. With proper optics, it is possible to resolve individual neurons. In the
video below, for example, hundreds of neurons can be observed in a few square millimeters.

We anticipate that this amazing scale of neural recording will allow us to link the neural
systems of learning and memory we study in the hippocampus with their downstream consequences
in the cortex. This exciting prospect, however, is challenged by the need for very large
microscopes to record these patterns, limiting current experimental paradigms to head-fixed
animals.

This motivates one of our key technological focuses. In conjunction with collaborators [Jacob
Robinson](http://robinsonlab.com) and [Ashok
Veerarhagavan](http://computationalimaging.rice.edu/) and [Rich
Baraniuk](http://richb.rice.edu/) we are developing a flat, lenseless [1,2] macroscope which
will allow us to conduct widefield imaging in freely moving rodents.

#### Imaging technologies - Fast, sensitive miniscopes
Direct imaging of activity in the hippocampus is made possible through the implantation of GRIN
lenses. We have been collaborating with the [UCLA
Miniscope](http://miniscope.org/index.php/Main_Page) team to develop a new image sensor which
enables neural activity to be observed with the minimum of excitation light and at maximum
frame rate [3]. The video below compares the original miniscope imager (inset) and our new system.

By minimizing excitation light, we find that we can image for hours without photobleaching.
This opens an avenue for studying the hippocampus of awake, behaving animals both during active
exploration and during the offline periods in which dynamic memory processes take place. By
using advanced signal processing and combining electrophysiology with optical imaging, we hope
to study both the behavioral timescale processes and the more rapid, SWR-associated patterns in
the hippocampus. In addition, with the ability to record up to 500 fps, we anticipate that as
genetically-encoded voltage indicators develop, we will eventually be able to record both
calcium-mediated and voltage-mediated fluorescence.
