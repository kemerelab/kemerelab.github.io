### Optimized detection and decoding of memory-related patterns of neural activity

<div class="lead">
Particular, temporally-limited patterns of neural firing appear to be one of
the mechanisms which enable information to be reliably stored and transmitted
between different brain regions and to/from the periphery. Most engineering
study of these patterns has focused on neuro-prosthetic interfaces. For
example, neural decoding to control prosthetic limbs, or spatio-temporally structured
stimulation to provide artificial sensory representations. What are the patterns of neural
activity that enable emotion, decision making, and memory? Recent results have suggested that
neural firing during hippocampal sharp wave ripple oscillations mayspecifically underly
particular forms of memory storage and recall ([1] and [2] and [3]).  What are the limits of
detecting, decoding, and controllably manipulating these patterns of activity in real-time?

We are building systems to answer these questions in rodents engaged in complex
learning and memory behaviors. Our experiments will build a foundation upon
which the understanding of the causal role of particular patterns of neural
activity can flourish, potentially leading to therapeutic work in humans
patients.
