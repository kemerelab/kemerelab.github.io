    <h2>Realtime Neural Engineering.</h2>
    <p class="lead"> We design systems to interact with complex neural circuits in vivo in
    behaving rodents. These systems enable us to explore how information is processed, stored,
    and retrieved in both healthy brains and in models of human neurological diseases and
    disorders. We’re focused on two areas: memory and deep brain stimulation.</p>

    <h2>Interacting with Memory</h2>
    <p class="lead">Forming, storing, and using memory requires the hippocampus. We are
    developing systems that translate ongoing neural activity into information and use this
    to manipulate the hippocampal circuit in real-time.  <em>Why is that useful?</em> We hope
    to build systems that will, for example, allow us to <span class="text-success"><em>selectively
        inhibit the recall or long-term storage of traumatic episodes.</em></span>

    <h2>Deep brain stimulation</h2>
    <p class="lead"><abbr title="Deep Brain Stimulation">DBS</abbr> - stimulation of midbrain
    regions with implanted electrodes - currently benefits patients with
    Parkinson&rquot;s disease despite its side effects and crude stimulation patterns. By
    understanding information flows in movement-generating neural circuits in healthy
    brains, how this flow is disrupted by disease, and how DBS changes the
    flow, we hope to <span class="text-success"><em>optimize DBS stimulation to maximize
        therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects</em></span>.

    <h2>Open Source Tools.</h2>
    <p class="lead">Our lab employs standard and cutting-edge techniques: simultaneously
    recording the activity of dozens of neurons in behaving rodents and manipulating
    genetically-selected populations of neurons using light (“optogenetics”). We also are
    developing a number of open source software and embedded systems tools for neuroscience
    and neural engineering that we are eager to share.
