    <h2>Realtime Neural Engineering.</h2>
    <p class="lead">We design systems to interact with complex neural circuits in vivo in
    behaving rodents. These systems enable us to explore how information is processed,
    stored, and retrieved in both healthy brains and in models of human neurological diseases
    and disorders. We’re focused on two areas: memory and movement.</p>

    <h2>Memory: <span class="text-muted">formation, storage, and
        recall.</span></h2>
    <p class="lead">Forming, storing, and using memory requires the hippocampus. Problems in
    the hippocampal circuit can lead to memory problems (e.g., Alzheimer's, PTSD) and also
    more complex disorders such as depression and anxiety. We'd like to understand how the
    hippocampal circuit works at a systems-level in healthy brains, how it goes wrong, and
    what can be done to change how it functions. We are developing the real-time systems that
    will allow us to use information decoded from neural activity to manipulate the
    hippocampal circuit. Why is that useful? By detecting the ensemble neural activity
    underlying traces of individual memories in real-time, we hope to build systems that
    will, for example, allow us to selectively inhibit the recall or long-term storage of
    traumatic episodes.</p>

    <h2>Deep brain stimulation</h2>
    <p class="lead">Generating intentional movements requires an interplay of cortical and
    subcortical neural circuits. This interplay is disrupted in Parkinson's disease, for
    example, as a result of loss of dopamine neurons in the basal ganglia. Deep brain
    stimulation (DBS) - high frequency stimulation of midbrain regions with implanted
    electrodes - has a significant benefit for patients with Parkinson's disease despite its
    side effects and crude stimulation patterns. By understanding how information flows in
    the cortical-basal ganglia circuits in healthy brains, how this flow is disrupted by
    Parkinson's disease, and how DBS can change the flow of information, we hope to optimize
    DBS stimulation to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects.</p>

    <h2>Open Source Tools. <span class="text-muted">Checkmate.</span></h2>
    <p class="lead">Our lab employs standard and cutting-edge techniques: simultaneously
    recording the activity of dozens of neurons in behaving rodents and manipulating
    genetically-selected populations of neurons using light (“optogenetics”). Please see the
    Research page for more specific information about experiments and technology in
    development.</p>
