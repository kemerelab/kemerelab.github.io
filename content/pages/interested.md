## Interested in joining our research team?

_Thanks for your interest!!_

### Postdocs

The Realtime Neural Engineering Lab is always looking for talented individuals
to join the lab. The ideal applicant would have experience doing neural
recordings in awake behaving animals, strong data analysis skills, and a
particular interest in real-time manipulation of neural coding. Applicants with
a background in signal processing algorithms and the desire to shift focus to
experimental neurobiology (i.e., learning techniques for electrophysiology in
awake behaving rodents) will also potentially be considered. 

Please send applications including an explanation of interest in particular projects, 
a CV, and contact information for two references to caleb.kemere [at] rice.edu.

### Graduate Students
We primarily welcome students in the Rice Electrical and Computer Engineering program,
 but also the Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience program (Prof. Kemere
is Adjunct Faculty at BCM), the SCBMB program, and other MD/PhD students from both BCM and
UTHS, as well as students in the Applied Physics, SSPB, or BIOE programs at Rice.
All of these programs have their own admissions processes. If you have applied
and have been accepted to one of these programs, Prof. Kemere is happy to respond to questions
to help you in your decision process.

If you are interested in working in the lab, please **take a close look at our
research** (read the research sections on the website and related papers).
Projects in the lab are focused on real-time neural signal processing
technology and related scientific questions about how dynamic neural activity
patterns support learning and memory. Most of our projects involve teams of students 
working together, well-thought-out animal experiments, and algorithmic and or 
embedded systems development. 

### Undergraduate Students

During a typical semester at Rice University, there are one to four undergraduates in the lab doing
research for course credit. The availability of these positions varies by year and depending on
the ebb and flow of ongoing research projects. Undergraduates typically assist with animal
behavioral experiments -- interest and excitement about neuroscience in behaving animal models
is a requirement for involvement in the lab. Students often additionally undertake embedded
systems, computational model, or data analysis projects under the oversight of other lab
members. Most projects are conducted as part of a team with graduate student or postdoctoral
mentors.

If you are interested in working in the lab, please **take a close look at our
research** (read the research sections on the website and related papers).
Then, please **send an email with your CV and a research statement explaining
your interest in the lab** (we can't reply to all generic emails received).
For student volunteers during the school year, we typically require a commitment of at 
least one full semester (multiple semesters are ideal) and at least 10 hours per week.

We occasionally welcome undergraduates who are not students at Rice University for summer
internships, but this typically requries bringing outside financial support.
