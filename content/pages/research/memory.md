### Memory-related patterns of neural activity

The field of learning and memory has grown tremendously over the last 50 years. 
While we now recognize the identity of the key regions of the brain which are
responsible for rapidly storing experience to enable memories to be initially
laid down and triggering their recall subsequently, how neurons in these regions
coordinate these processes both online, and critically, _offline_ during sleep
is not yet understood.

Our research has focused on burst of activity known as sharp wave ripples
which are found during periods of quiescence during learning and novel experience
and are highly prevelant during slow wave sleep. We believe that these
momentary periods hold the key to unlocking our understanding of memory.

### Closed-loop signal processing and neuroscience

While numerous studies have correlated ripples and memory, the key to demonstrating
the fundamental importance of momentary bursts of activity is to manipulate them
online. We are developing approaches for interacting with ripples by detecting
and manipulating them in closed loop. We were among the first to carry out these
types of causal experiments [1], and we continue to work in this area [2].

We have collected publications that are related to closed-loop
interaction with the hippocampus / learning-and-memory system in a Zotero library.
