## Realtime Neural Engineering.

Our lab designs new ways of understanding and interacting with complex neural circuits in vivo.
Our approaches enable new ways to explore how information is processed, stored, 
and retrieved in both healthy brains and in models of human neurological diseases and 
disorders. The experimental neurobiological topics we focus most on are understanding
[memory](#research-memory) - how knowledge is integrated and stored, including
during periods of offline processing. Our forte is the use of closed-loop signal processing
to demonstrate the causal signficance of specific patterns of ensemble activity. We also
develop <a href="#research-latents">new algorithms to make sense of large amounts of data</a>, 
and new <a href="#research-tools">neural interface technologies, systems and software</a>
that are shared as open source.

## Interacting with Memory {: id="research-memory"}

Forming memories involves converting the patterns of activity
which occur during experience into stable representations in distributed circuits in the brain. 
Brief bursts of activity during quiescence and sleep within a brain region called the hippocampus
coordinate the process of storing and recalling memories. To understand these critical phenomena, 
we are developing systems that translate ongoing neural activity into information and use this 
to manipulate related circuits in real-time. By demonstrating a causal understanding of memory, we 
hope to enable therapies that might, for example, allow us to _selectively
inhibit the recall or long-term storage of traumatic episodes_.

## Understanding the brain with machine learning {: id="research-latents"}

Cutting edge systems neuroscience involves simultaneous observation of ensembles of 
hundreds of individual neurons. The promise of these observations is that they enable us to
understand the _internal representatiosn_ encoded within neural circuits. This is particularly
critical during periods like sleep in which animals are not behaving, and there are not external
variables to correlate signals with. We are developing new approaches for observing and understanding
the latent variables that underly learning, memory, decision making, and other critical cognitive
functions. Recent papers using [Statistical Decoding](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07397-x),

## Open Source Tools. {: id="research-tools"}

We are developing a number of new technologies, open source software and 
embedded systems tools for neuroscience experiments including spectral data analysis, 
imaging, virtual reality, and deep brain stimulation. We are eager to share!
