        <h2>Realtime Neural Engineering.</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            Our lab designs new ways of understanding and interacting with complex neural circuits in vivo.
            Our approaches enable new ways to explore how information is processed, stored, 
            and retrieved in both healthy brains and in models of human neurological diseases and 
            disorders. The experimental neurobiological topics we focus most on are understanding
            <a href="/#research-memory">memory</a> - how knowledge is integrated and stored, including
            during periods of offline processing. Our forte is the use of closed-loop signal processing
            to demonstrate the causal signficance of specific patterns of ensemble activity. We also
            develop <a href="#research-latents">new algorithms to make sense of large amounts of data</a>, 
            and new <a href="#research-tools">neural interface technologies, systems and software</a>
            that are shared as open source.</p>

        <h2>Interacting with Memory</h2>
        <p class="lead">Forming memories involves converting the patterns of activity
            which occur during experience into stable representations in distributed circuits in the brain. 
            Brief bursts of activity during quiescence and sleep within a brain region called the hippocampus
            coordinate the process of storing and recalling memories. To understand these critical phenomena, 
            we are developing systems that translate ongoing neural activity into information and use this 
            to manipulate related circuits in real-time. By demonstrating a causal understanding of memory, we 
            hope to enable therapies that might, for example, allow us to <em>selectively
            inhibit the recall or long-term storage of traumatic episodes.</em>

        <h2>Understanding the brain with machine learning</h2>
        <p class="lead">Cutting edge systems neuroscience involves simultaneous observation of ensembles of 
            hundreds of individual neurons. The promise of these observations is that they enable us to
            understand the <em>internal representatiosn</em> encoded within neural circuits. This is particularly
            critical during periods like sleep in which animals are not behaving, and there are not external
            variables to correlate signals with. We are developing new approaches for observing and understanding
            the latent variables that underly learning, memory, decision making, and other critical cognitive
            functions.
